## Description
Welcome to our Infusion Pump and ICU Monitor prototype project! This demo showcases an infusion pump that is intelligently controlled by the patient's vital signs, specifically the heart rate.


## Hardware Components 
1. Stepper motor (from recycled cd rom [learn more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJxB2O2FsAo))
2. Arduino Uno board
3. Heart Rate sensor ([get it here](https://ram-e-shop.com/product/kit-pulse-rate/))
4. H bridge (L298N module) ([get it here](https://ram-e-shop.com/product/kit-l298-red/)) 
5. Arduino Bluetooth module ([get it here](https://ram-e-shop.com/product/kit-bluetooth-hc05/))
6. Medical syringe

## How to Use
1. Place the heart rate sensor on the patient's hand to measure the heart rate.
2. The infusion pump adjusts the speed of drug infusion based on the detected heart rate.
3. If the heart rate is outside the normal range, the infusion pump automatically adapts to ensure optimal drug delivery.

## Limitations
- Heart rate sensor is not accurate enough / not in contact at all times
- Stepper motor might not be strong enough for viscous infusion solutions
